# metodologie2019_progetto
Semantic factory project, course of programming methodologies year 2019

This project aims to create a collaborative annotation platform
and validation of linguistic and visual data. The platform has one component
front-end and a back-end. The front-end part will take care of creating all the pages
of interaction with the user, while the back-end will be responsible for processing and
save the data provided by the user.
The application will ideally run on a server machine, that is, on a machine
reachable via the internet and searchable via the HTTP protocol. For the purposes of
delivery, however, it will always be possible to use and run everything on its own
development machine, using the localhost address (127.0.0.1).
The project is a client-server application, so you will need to install Tomcat
(a web application server that hosts web services developed in Java) on its own
remote computer or server.
If the application is run locally, the website home will be:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/fabbricasemantica/index.html

This project is written in Java using the JSweet library which allows you to create
HTML pages using only Java functions.
To optimize this work I used some design templates.
For the backend I used MySql

This project was valued 35/35.
